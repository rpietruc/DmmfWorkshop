// Exercise 4:
// =================================

This demonstrates how an imperative implemention (with IO mixed in with logic)
can be converted to a impure/pure/impure sandwich

Read through and understand all the code
* 04a-AnagramGame-Imperative.fsx
* 04b-AnagramGame-Functional.fsx

Another approach is to use an interpreter (aka Free Monad)
* 04c-AnagramGame-Interpreter.fsx
